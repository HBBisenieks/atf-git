Applied Technology Fellowship Example Git Repository
====================================================

This is an example repository to demonstrate the basics
of using git and github to centrally store, manage, and 
collaborate on code.

If you like macaroni and cheese, you may be interested 
in mac-and-cheese.txt, which contains a recipe (really 
more of a framework) for macaroni and cheese that I've 
been using and experimenting with for over a decade now.

If you don't like macaroni and cheese (and aren't lactose 
intolerant or something), what's your deal?
